GETTING STARTED:

NOTE: The executable also takes command line arguments, to find out give the -h command to display options
      Service is enabled on port 55551 for stats reporting for awesome miner.

1. Update miner address to yours (Make sure not to use an exchange address)
2. Update miner name that is unique to you

3. Update parameters describe below:

Parameters:

work_size_factor:
==========================

This multiples the default work group size with the work_size_factor.
This requires tuning to find optimal value for your GPU.
We will work on getting a doc to help you identify the best values and
implement a auto adjusting function in the future

Example:
work_size_factor=1,2,1

This will use:
setting of 1 for GPU0
setting of 2 for GPU1
setting of 1 for GPU2
if there's a forth GPU it will default to the last value.

Setting that seem ok for 1080/1070/1060 cards is:
work_size_factor=1

which will apply 1 to all the cards

AMD Cards seem to like larger work sizes such as 5

cpu_damping_factor
==========================

Default: 0.6

This controls the amount of time to sleep between sending work and getting result.
Its meant to work around the driver issue of pegging the CPU. A setting of 1.0
means we will sleep roughly the amount of time to work.
NOTE: Currently this is disabled in this verison

do_not_mine_on_gpu_number
==========================

Default: -1

A list of GPU to skip for mining.

Example:
do_not_mine_on_gpu_number=0,1

This will skip GPU0 and GPU1 and don't mine on those.

Support questions please join bismuth discord and post on #coinsaurus

batch_size
==========================
Default is 16384. Valid values are: 64,128,256,512,1024,2048,4096,8192,16384
Batch size along with work_size_factor affect how long each kernel executes and together affect hashrate.

NVIDIA cards under linux with batch size 64 yields the highest hash rate but not true for Windows.

Junction File
=========================
Junction file required for new bismuth mining algorithm.
This specifics the file path for the file. i.e [/tmp/heavy3a.bin]
